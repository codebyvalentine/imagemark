I've updated the favicon to use a custom ImageMark icon. The favicon now features:

- A teal-colored image frame representing the main functionality
- A white overlay area showing the watermark concept
- A green checkmark circle indicating protection/verification
- A small watermark indicator in the corner

This creates a cohesive brand identity that clearly represents ImageMark's watermarking functionality while maintaining professional appearance across all browsers and devices.
